#SIMPLE TRADE JOURNAL

I created this tool to remove the tedium involved with journaling day trades.
* This only works for Webull right now since I use Webull

### What it can do today
* Ingest trades organized by symbol for a day
* Create a spreadsheet showing the per symbol P & L
* Show the Day P & L

### Current limitations 
* This doesn't work for trades over multiple days 
* This doesn't work on any complex strategy at the moment, it will only organized trades by symbol and calculate the P&L and give you space to add notes
* This doesn't account for open positions because I'm a day trader, so it assumes the input are all closed trades

## Next
* Be able to ingest multiple days of orders
* Be able to ingest an entire order history and create a journal for it

## Further
Create a website so others can use it!!!
